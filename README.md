## Javascript Fundementals Challenge Three (Part One)💪🏾

Aisha wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever she goes eating in a restaurant. In her country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is between 50 and 300. If the value is different, the tip is 20%.

##### Your Task 😃:
1. Calculate the tip, depending on the bill value. Create a variable called `tip` for this
2. Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the final value (bill + tip). Example: *'The bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value 316.25'*

Good Luck 😀
